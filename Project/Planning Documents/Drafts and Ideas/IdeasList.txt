---------------Application Ideas--------------------

* Application that can be used to make notes. Ability to add, remove, edit, and update notes. Potentially can add a login system.

* (Continuting with old project) An Admin Terminal to add, remove, edit, and delete Adventures. Adventurers are randomly generated via chat GPT. This would
    more or less be an tool that an admin can use to make changes/approve of randomly generated Adventurers. Perhaps non logged in users can view approved
    Adventurers.

* Iventory management system. Add, remove, edit, and update quantity of items. Perhaps add login functionality/multi location functionality.

* Continuation of the Mobile Book store completed in sprint; create the API and create business tools that can show inventory of a location, purchase of a receipt, etc...
