----------------------------------------------------Application Ideas---------------------------------------------------------

* Application that can be used to make notes. Ability to add, remove, edit, and update notes. Potentially can add a 
    login system.

* (Continuting with old project) An Admin Terminal to add, remove, edit, and delete Adventures. Adventurers are randomly 
    generated via chat GPT. This would more or less be an tool that an admin can use to make changes/approve of randomly 
    generated Adventurers. Perhaps non logged in users can view approved Adventurers. This api will be developed later 
    into a game.

* Iventory management system. Add, remove, edit, and update quantity of items. Perhaps add login functionality/multi location
    functionality.

* Continuation of the Mobile Book store completed in sprint; create the API and create business tools that can show inventory 
    of a location, purchase of a receipt, etc...

Final Verdict:

Without confirmation, I think I'm gonna stick with the EJS and SQL Stack, which rules out the old project. 
(March 17 as I write this).

While it's a bit more than the one table, I think it woul be fun to continue the Mobile book store from the sprint. I think I'll
focus more on the books API for adding, removing, and editing book information, but I'll set up the project so that I can expand
on it later. I'll also update the data to have even more records, so the book queries have more "meat" to them.
